    Overview:

        Shader program 'samalg':
            Get shader desc: samalg_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_vs_isbottomvertex = 1
                Uniform block 'samalg_vs_params':
                    C struct: samalg_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_samalg_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader samalg = sg_make_shader(samalg_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_isbottomvertex] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});


    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]


    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'samalg_vs_params':

        samalg_vs_params_t samalg_vs_params = {
            .mvp = ...;
            .top_color = ...;
            .bottom_color = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_samalg_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(samalg_vs_params));
