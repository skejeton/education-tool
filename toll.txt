1. Fetching the tile ID and then the model ID is extremely inefficent for every
   tile in the world.

2. There's no way to index specific models by string right now, we can have a
   hack-in solution but I'll create another toll entry since it seems generic
   to handle mnemonics.

3. The iterators right now are clumsy to use, I should generalize iteration.
   The best candidate right now is to just have an `iter` overload function
   for all iterable types, that we can use as a shorthand. If nothing better
   comes up after I finish the November demo, that's what I'm going to do.

4. Continuous iteration without inserting hacks before the loop. Example: we
   have several tiles, one of them is "nothing", we also need to show that as a
   button in the editor, however obviously that's implied to be the NULL tile.
   Maybe the NULL tile should not be default, and only signify invalid IDs?
