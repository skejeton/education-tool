> Description
This document contains the technical debt and compromises made during the development process.

It's a crucial part of the software development process, helping the team keep track of areas where shortcuts or less-than-ideal solutions were implemented. It ensures that these compromises are documented and can be revisited for future improvements.

1. Inefficient title and model id fetching: Fetching the tile ID and then the model ID is extremely inefficent for every
   tile in the world. (What are the implications? How can we fix this?)

2. Lack of string indexing for models

4. Continuous iteration without inserting hacks before the loop. Example: we
   have several tiles, one of them is "nothing", we also need to show that as a
   button in the editor, however obviously that's implied to be the NULL tile.
   Maybe the NULL tile should not be default, and only signify invalid IDs?
