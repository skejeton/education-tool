# This document contains a guide on what to do and what not to do in this
  project.


1. DO NOT use references in struct fields.
   it makes any kind of initialization hell, makes move semantics and other
   memory operations much more difficult than it already is. However, check
   (R2).

2. DO use references for function parameters and return values when null is not
   needed. This removes the need for ugly `->` syntax. If you need to store it
   to follow (R1) take the pointer of it. If you want to load from struct,
   dereference it, it will not do any copy.

3. DO NOT use asserts for user errors. Asserts are only for errors made by
   programmers of the C++ codebase, C++ asserts must not be used for in game
   scripting - the game MUST NOT crash due to a faulty input, be it a script or
   a wrong press, use errors where applicable.
