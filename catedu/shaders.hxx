                    Bind slot: SLOT_ui_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: ui_fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader ui_prog = sg_make_shader(ui_prog_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'boxdraw_vs':

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.images[] or .fs.images[]


    Sampler bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs.sampler[] or .fs.samplers[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'boxdraw_vs_params':
